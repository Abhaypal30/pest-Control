        Protect Your Business from Rats and Mice – Before They Cause Real Damage!
    </p>
    <p class="pst_toppadder10">
        Did you know the National Pest Management Association marks a special “Rodent Awareness Week” each year to educate businesses on the dangers of rodent infestations?<br>
        Rodents aren’t just a nuisance — they are dangerous pests known to cause structural damage, contaminate food, chew through wiring, and spread diseases. Whether it’s a food unit, hospital, warehouse, or society, rodent control is non-negotiable.
    </p>

    <h3 class="pst_toppadder20">🏢 Businesses That Must Take Rodent Control Seriously</h3>
    <ol class="pst_toppadder10">
        <li><strong>Food Processing Units:</strong> Food factories attract rats and mice like magnets. With food being stored, packed, and moved in large volumes, you need a robust rodent control solution to prevent contamination and damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Food Retail Outlets & Grocery Stores:</strong> Packets, grains, and open displays — rodents love it all. With easy access from entrances and storage zones, regular rodent management is crucial.</li>
        <li><strong>Offices:</strong> Don’t let rats chew through your important documents, wires, or ceiling panels. Offices with wooden partitions or storage rooms are common breeding grounds.</li>
        <!-- <li><strong>Manufacturing Units:</strong> Large spaces, equipment, and heavy foot traffic make manufacturing units an ideal habitat for rodents. One infestation can shut down production and risk your workforce’s safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Housing Societies:</strong> Rodents damage wires, chew plumbing lines, and make basements or duct areas their home. Societies should opt for scheduled rodent pest control services to protect both infrastructure and residents’ peace of mind.</li>
        <li><strong>Warehouses & Logistics Centers:</strong> One rodent can destroy hundreds of packaged items. Ensure your stock remains safe and contamination-free by conducting timely rodent inspections and baiting.</li> -->
