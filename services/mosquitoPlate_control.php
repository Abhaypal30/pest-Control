    <h3 class="span_ele pst_toppadder20">🕒 Best Time for Mosquito Control</h3>
    <p class="pst_toppadder10">
        The ideal time for mosquito control is right before or at the onset of the rainy season — typically starting in March. 
        Early treatment ensures maximum protection throughout the monsoon months. 
        Regular sprays can help but professional treatment is always safer and more effective.
    </p>

    <h3 class="pst_toppadder20">🔄 Our Mosquito Control Treatment Process</h3>
    <ol class="black-dot-list pst_toppadder10">
        <li><strong>Inspection:</strong> We inspect your home and surroundings for breeding sites.</li>
        <li><strong>Breeding Site Treatment:</strong> Stagnant water treated with safe anti-larval solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Protective Measures:</strong> Covering furniture and dusting walls before spraying.</li>
        <li><strong>Encapsulated Spray:</strong> Safe, powerful spray applied on mosquito hiding spots.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="pst_toppadder20">🕰️ How Long Does Treatment Last?</h3>
    <p class="pst_toppadder10">
        The treatment provides effective protection for up to <strong>30 days</strong>. 
        After that, the chemicals naturally lose effectiveness, so repeat treatment is recommended during peak season.
